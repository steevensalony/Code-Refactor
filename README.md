## HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

This is the first challenge for the Bootcmap course which requires us to refactor a code.

## What it means:

We are given a code that already works, but fails to follow accessibility standards, we have to refactor the code so that it follows those standards without changing what the code does.
This challenge taught me to write cleaner code, to be more descriptive with my tags so that the code may be easier to read by me later on and by other developers.

## Instalation

To install this code, simply click on the url to my repository [https://github.com/steevensalony/code-refactor] and clone the ssh key to your local machine. 
this is also the link to the refactored website [file:///Users/steeven/code-refactor/02-Challenge/Develop/index.html]

## Usage

This may be used as a guide on how to properly follow accessibility standards when writing HTML and CSS code.
